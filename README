* Introduction

zhfonts is a module for ConTeXt MkIV. It can help some users to try ConTeXt MkIV based LuaTeX for Chinese typesetting.

The zhfonts is implemented by using "nodes.tasks.appendaction('processors','after', 'my_callback_function')" which is offered by ConTeXt MkIV.Therefore I could not guarantee zhfonts works all along unless my_callback_function is always valid.
